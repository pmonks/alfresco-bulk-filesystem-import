Until [issue #155](https://github.com/pmonks/alfresco-bulk-filesystem-import/issues/155) is addressed, please refer to the [Google Code project](http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-bulk-filesystem-import/) for documentation etc.

In the meantime, here are some links that may be useful:

* [Blog post describing the approach](http://blogs.alfresco.com/wp/pmonks/2009/10/22/bulk-import-from-a-filesystem/) (very out of date at this point)

Finally, development of v2.0 of the tool moved to github some time ago, and is being managed as a [separate project](https://github.com/pmonks/alfresco-bulk-import).  This project will remain in place for those who wish to access older versions of the tool (e.g. those who are still using Alfresco v4.x or earlier).
